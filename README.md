Hello! This is my first time writing a README on github but today I will be talking about my project!

So I'm sure you all may be wondering. "What is this project?" or "Why did you do this project?" and I will answer those questions right now.

Starting off this project is a recreation of a design created by Finsweet on Figma. I decided that remaking other's figma designs and turning them into real websites that would
seriously improve the eye looks on my portfolio. By showing that I can recreate a figma design and even make it responsive for mobile devices I think it shows a lot on what I can do
as a Junior Web dev myself.

So I guess that pretty much answered both questions so this project took my really about 3 almost 4 weeks to finish as I've never really made a mobile responsive website and was 
always addicted to making multi page websites. But again they were never responsive.. 

I hope you all like my recreation for whoever views this! and I will have the link to the Figma project here.
